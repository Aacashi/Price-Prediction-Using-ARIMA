This repository contains code and analysis for predicting stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The project aims to leverage the ARIMA model to make accurate stock price forecasts based on historical data.
<br>
Overview:
<br>
ARIMA Model: A popular statistical method for time series forecasting that uses past values and past forecast errors to predict future values.
<br>
Stock Price Prediction: Application of the ARIMA model to forecast future stock prices based on historical closing prices.
<br>
Features:
<br>
Data Collection: Scripts to fetch historical stock price data from various financial data sources.
<br>
Data Preprocessing: Code to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and transforming the data as needed.
<br>
Model Training: Implementation of the ARIMA model, including parameter selection and model fitting.
<br>
Prediction and Evaluation: Generating future stock price predictions and evaluating the model's performance using various metrics.
<br>
Visualization: Graphs and charts to visualize the historical data, model fit, and prediction results.
